    Journal: contains all the entries. This will also be able to be saved in a .csv file and displayed.
        Behaviors:
            -	display(_entriesNew): Takes all written journal entries from a file and display it (loop and display all entries using displayEntry)
            
            -	save(_entriesNew): Save the text of the journal to a .csv file, taking all of its entries with it

            -	load(): Looks through .csv file, displays options to load. Prompts user for which entry in the journal they want to load.
            
            -	save(): Saves journal to .csv file, replacing its text, maybe merge the two entry lists together, 
                and replace everything. Or, just tag the current entries on to the .csv file into the appropriate section. Calls the journalâ€™s save

        Attributes:
            -	_entriesOld: A list of entries made up from the Entry class, ones that have already been saved. 
                These are where the .csv text will be loaded into.
            
            -	_entriesNew: This is where new entries will be saved, and these are the entries that will be written to the file.
            -   List<Entries> newEntries: This will be a list of entry objects, added after each entry is completed

            -	write(_promptList from PromptGenerator): Creates a new entry with the datetime as the title (maybe, maybe another title). 
                Runs the prompts and continues to prompt until the user saves, or the questions run out. 
                Takes these text entries as new entry classes, and adds them to the journal class list of entries.
